# WCPS 2017

Those codes are the ones I used during my participation to the "World Champions
Programming School" in Toulouse, in October 2017.

This was a one-week training for programming contests such as ACM ICPC,
organized by ITMO University, ENS Lyon, IRIT and Universit√© Paul Sabatier.
The problems were gathered from the CodeForces platform.

Most of those codes are written in Python. Some are written in C++ for better
performance.
